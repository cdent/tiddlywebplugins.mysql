This is a stub README for a new TiddlyWeb plugin.

The entire maker package provides a sort of fill in the blank
opportunity for creating TiddlyWeb plugins in the tiddylwebplugins
namespace.

Rename tiddlywebplugins/example.py to the name you want to use for
your plugin. Edit setup.py to set the variables at the top of the 
file. Edit your plugin file to add the necessary code. Edit this
README so it provides a description of the plugin.

Put some tests, if you wish, in the tests dir. TiddlyWeb uses py.test
as its testing harness. http://pytest.org/

See http://www.python.org/~jeremy/weblog/030924.html for some
info on how to register for PyPI.

If you have suggestions for things to add to maker post at the
TiddlyWeb Google Group: http://groups.google.com/group/tiddlyweb

To start with maker itself clone this repo, and then remove .git
directory.
