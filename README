A plugin for TiddlyWeb subclassing tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy with mysql specifics.

The main additions here are two:

* Provide a reasonable search interface using mysql's fulltext.
* Provide an index_query method to allow the plugin to be used as
  an 'indexer' for filters and determine_bag_for_tiddler.

This means we'll be incorporating code learnings from
tiddlywebplugins.whoosher and tiddlywebplugins.mappinsql. In fact
this plugin is being built to replace tiddlywebplugins.whoosher
which doesn't handle concurrency well.

NOTES

It's import to set some mysql my.cnf variables otherwise searches
will likely fail.

[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len = 3
ft_stopword_file = ''

You will need to create a database. I use one called 'tiddlyweb', and
add the following to tiddlywebconfig.py:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.mysql', {
        'db_config': 'mysql:///tiddlyweb?charset=utf8&use_unicode=0'}],
    'indexer': 'tiddlywebplugins.mysql',

Thanks to Adrian Hosey <http://adrianhosey.blogspot.com/> for help over
some SQL humps.
