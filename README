A plugin for TiddlyWeb subclassing tiddlywebplugins.sqlalchemy with mysql specifics.

This package is superceeded by tiddlywebplugins.mysql2 which has
better performance and robustness by using a different schema.

Copyright 2011, Chris Dent <cdent@peermore.com>

Licensed as TiddlyWeb itself.

NOTES

It's import to set some mysql my.cnf variables otherwise searches
will likely fail.

[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len = 3
ft_stopword_file = ''

You will need to create a database. I use one called 'tiddlyweb', and
add the following to tiddlywebconfig.py:

    'server_store': ['tiddlywebplugins.mysql', {
        'db_config': 'mysql:///tiddlyweb?charset=utf8&use_unicode=0'}],
    'indexer': 'tiddlywebplugins.mysql',

Thanks to Adrian Hosey <http://adrianhosey.blogspot.com/> for help over
some SQL humps.
